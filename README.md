## 📖 Project Description  
I developed a fully responsive **Tiffin Ordering Web Application** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The platform, titled **TiffinBites**, showcases a wide range of South Indian breakfast items in a visually appealing and user-friendly menu layout.  

Users can **browse the menu**, **search for items** using a live search bar, and **adjust item quantities** using "+" and "−" buttons. The selected items are dynamically added to a **shopping cart**, which updates the **total price and quantity** in real time. A **popup cart summary** provides a clear view of all selected items with item-wise cost breakdown.  

The project also includes an **About Us section** explaining the story and values of the brand, as well as a **Feedback Form** where users can submit their comments and ratings.  

I used **JavaScript DOM manipulation** extensively for handling dynamic interactions like search filtering, cart updates, and popup visibility. The website design is clean and modern, created with custom **CSS styling**, including hover effects, flexible layouts, and form styling.  

This project highlights my skills in **front-end development**, **UX design**, and **client-side JavaScript programming** to create a complete user experience from browsing to checkout.
